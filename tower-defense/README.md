This is supposed to be a tower defense game.
Before the each defense round begins, a resource round plays out.
The idea is that there's a centre section that is hidden unless the player is inside it.
One of several creature types will spawn there each second:
  - Neutral traders
  - Mercenaries
  - Friendly fighters
  - Hostile mobs

If a hostile mob spawns then it will attack everyone else in the box.
The player can defeat a hostile mob easily enough,
but spending all their time inside the spawn box means they're not gathering resources from the map to trade with or buy mercenaries.
Luckily, if a friendly fighter has already spawned or a mercenary has been bought, they can take care of a hostile mob within a few rounds.

Once the resource round begins, the player chooses where to place the friendly fighters and purchased mercenaries before the wave spawns.
The wave will try to reach a target, following specific rules like being attracted to, repelled by, slowed down by, or damaged by various items.

If the player sets up the items and fighters well enough, all of the wave will be killed before it reaches its target.

# TO Do
- Change the way the items divs are rendered and tracked so the player can enter the box of another entity without replacing it.
- Add central spawn box
- Add creatures
- Add tower defense mechanics
